## we need to take one micro SD card and by using an Card reader or an adapter we connect it to our laptop in order to install the raspbian OS in it.

### Steps need to follow

#### Step 1: Download and Install Raspberry Pi Imager.
	--> Download Raspberry Pi Imager from RaspberryPi.org/software. 
	    There are versions for Windows, Mac, Ubuntu, and Raspberry Pi OS itself. 
	    Chose the one that works for you, and install it just like you would any other program.

#### Step 2: Run Raspberry Pi Imager and Format the SD Card.
	--> With the target SD Card inserted into your computer or external card reader, open Raspberry Pi Imager.
	    When you run Raspberry Pi Imager you are presented with two options: 
	    1. Choose OS and 2. Choose SD Card.
        --> Scroll down to the bottom of the list and click on the Erase option.
             Now click the "Choose SD Card" Option and select the target SD Card.
             Note that any data still on this SD card will be erased forever, and you should ensure that you have a backup of any files you would like to keep.
             With the SD Card Selected the "Write" option becomes available. Click Write and wait for the process to complete. Once the process is complete, a                        notification window will open letting you know that it's now ok to remove the SD card from the reader.
             Remove the SD Card and reinsert it into the reader to make it available again.

#### Step 3: Burn the Raspberry Pi OS Image to the SD Card.
       --> Click the "Choose OS" button, and select one of the available operating systems.
           Select  the SD Card.
           Use some advanced setting for enabling wifi settings for our raspberry pi by using the command "ctrl+shift+x".
           and finally write the os to the SD card and eject it.

#### Step 4: put the SD card that is ejected in raspberry pi sd card slot.

#### Step 5: finally give  the power supply to the raspberry pi.

#### follow the next steps which were in installation and nextcloud folders.
